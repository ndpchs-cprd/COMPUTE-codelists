Welcome to the COMPUTE-codelists project, a comprehensive repository dedicated to assembling medical codelists for a large-scale research initiative known as COMPUTE. Our primary goal is to create a collection of codelists for various medical conditions to facilitate medical research, analysis, and outcomes assessment.
