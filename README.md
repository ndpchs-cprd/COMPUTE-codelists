# COMPUTE-codelists Project

## Project Overview
COMPUTE-codelists is a project dedicated to assembling comprehensive medical codelists for a large-scale research initiative known as COMPUTE. This repository contains not only the codelists but also the scripts used to generate them and metadata detailing their assembly process. The primary source for these codelists is the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF), supplemented by other relevant medical dictionaries and repositories.

The research reported was supported by a fellowship from the Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH). Ongoing work is part of the CoMPuTE project, funded by the NIHR Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (NIHR204406). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.

## Repository Structure
- **/codelists**: Contains the assembled codelists for various medical conditions.
- **/scripts**: Python scripts used to generate and manage the codelists.
- **/metadata**: Documentation describing the assembly process and additional details about the codelists.
- **/tests**: Test scripts to ensure proper functionality and integration of scripts.
